## Analyzing Data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US.
The dataset came from [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/) and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015).
 The dataset is stored in the [thanksgiving.csv](thanksgiving.csv). It contains 1058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.
 Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location.
 
 I tried discovering regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.
